This file describes how to compile ExnerFOAM, the code described in the paper:

Weller and Shahrokhi, submitted to Monthly Weather review, 2014:
http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~sws02hs/nearPublications/WellerShahrokhi2014.pdf

For help, please contact Hilary Weller <h.weller@reading.ac.uk>

To compile and run ExnerFoam, first install OpenFOAM and test your installation:

http://www.openfoam.com/

Then move the contents of this tar archive to directory:

$WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR

To compile the necessary additional libraries for ExnerFoam, go to directory:

$WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR/src

and run command:

wmake all

To compile the two versions of ExnerFOAM described in the paper, go to directory:

$WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR/applications/solvers/ExnerFoam

ane run command:

wmake all

You will then need to create meshes, input files and setup initial conditions before you can run exnerFoam or exnerFoamH. Contact h.weller@reading.ac.uk for help with this.
